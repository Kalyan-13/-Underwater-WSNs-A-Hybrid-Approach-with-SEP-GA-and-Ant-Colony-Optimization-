 Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) play a crucial role in various applications,including oceanographic research, environmental monitoring, and underwater surveillance.
 However, the unique characteristics of the underwater environment, such as high latency, limited bandwidth, and energy constraints, pose significant challenges to network design 
 and operation. 

 In this context, the Stable Election Protocol (SEP) using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges and optimize the performance of 
 UWSNs.

 We propose the optimization of the stability period the sensor network and optimizing tool used here is genetic algorithm (GA). For the proficiency in stability period, the GA is applied on SEP.
 SEP leverages the principles of ACO to intelligently select cluster heads (CHs) and organize data transmission, thereby prolonging the network's lifetime, enhancing reliability, and improving energy
 efficiency. This paper provides an overview of SEP using ACO in UWSNs, highlighting its key features, benefits, and implementation aspects. Through simulations and evaluations, the effectiveness 
 of SEP in improving network longevity, packet delivery ratio, and energy consumption is demonstrated, showcasing its potential for real-world deployment in underwater
 environments.
